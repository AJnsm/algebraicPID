# The Fast Möbius transform: An algebraic approach to decompose information
An introduction to the algebraic PID and the Möbius function. The notebook contains the code to calculate the Möbius function for up to 5 variables. It also shows how to use the Möbius function to calculate the 5-variable PID. The Möbius functions are stores as sparse scipy arrays in the `antichain_outputs/` directory, together with `.csv`'s that contain the list of antichains, in the same ordering as the Möbius function entries.
